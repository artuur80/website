                For the second semester of my studies I decided to to an internship abroad.
                After discussing with our international coach and with the university of Sankt Pölten I was ready to head to Austria.
                My internship was about a new Steganography technique that would use BitTorrent to make it more efficient.
                Here in Sankt Pölten I was not the only study that came to do their Erasmus.
                We were in total around 20 people coming from all over the world: Ecuador, South-Africa, Russia, Azerbaijan, Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, UK and Belgium.
                In the week before their studies we had a lot of activities to get to know each other better.
                After a month of doing my internship COVID-19 changed the erasmus.
                I had to work from my apartment instead of the university.
                All travel had been cancelled.
                During this period I made a deeper connection with a few erasmus students.
                Every other evening we would play boardgames to keep ourselves entertained.
