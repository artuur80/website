                <p>For the second semester of my studies I decided to do an internship abroad.
                    The what I would do did not matter that much to me.
                    It would be doing Erasmus that would be my key point to travel.
                    After discussing with my international coach and with the university of Sankt PÃ¶lten I was ready to
                    head to Austria.
                    My internship was about a new Steganography technique that would use BitTorrent to make it more
                    efficient.
                    The weekend before my internship started I came here to Austria and explored the region with my
                    parents.
                    After some time more and more students from other countries were coming to the same university to
                    study here.
                    We were in total around 20 people coming from all over the world: Ecuador, South-Africa, Russia,
                    Azerbaijan, Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, UK and Belgium.
                    In the week before their studies, while I had already started my internship, we had a lot of group
                    activities to get to know each other better.
                    This included a dinner, yoga, bowling, team building and more.
                    I got appointed an office in the university.
                    In the fist month apart from doing my internship, I would often meat the other erasmus students in
                    the common room in the building were I was staying.
                    During the weekend we also did trips and saw some cities or we want partying.
                    After a month of doing my internship COVID-19 changed the erasmus.
                    I had to work from my apartment instead of the university.
                    All travel had been cancelled.
                    Some of the students went home.
                    During this period I made a deeper connection with a few erasmus students.
                    Every other evening we would play boardgames to keep ourselves entertained.
                    At the end of my internship I decided to stay in Austria a little longer than the internship period.
