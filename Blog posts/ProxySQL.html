                This evening was about ProxySQL and was split into different parts.
                The speakers were Vlad Fedorkov (ProxySQL) Frederic Descamps (Oracle) Marco Tusa (Percona) Matthias Crauwels (Pythian) Alexander Rubin (VirtualHealth)
                First we got an introduction into what ProxySQL is.
                They explained us what the fine details of ProxySQL were.
                Then later on we got to hear other companies that implemented ProxySQL into their business.
                I chose this event because I wanted to see how SQL was used in different companies.
                ProxySQL uses SQL and I don't think that it would be used all that often.
                Although I didn't get a specific answer it was a really wonderful evening with lots of things to learn.
                However some of the guest speakers went into details that were sometimes to specific to talk about.
                This event was not as memorable as some of the other event that I went to.
                In the future if the topic are interesting I will go to such an event.
                I would recommend it because of the free drinks and food.</p>
                We got pizza.
